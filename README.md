# TAQ-CRSP-Link

## Notice

WRDS has a new group of utilities that are much easier to use and more reliable. It is called the **Linking Suite by WRDS** and it contains **Daily TAQ CRSP Link** which is much better than the previous macro that they had and probably should be your first choice.



### Old README 
An updated version of the TCLINK.sas macro from WRDS. The WRDS macro was last updated in 2010 and NYSE has since changed the TAQ specifications, so the macro no longer works properly. This new version, named `TCLINK_v3.sas`, works on the millisecond version of the TAQ Master files, which have consistent data beginning in 2011. The old TCLINK macro will work prior to 2011 with no changes.

The TCLINK_v3 macro returns trading symbol root-symbol suffix-CRSP PERMNO pairings and the continuous date ranges that apply. This is different than the output of the WRDS macro, which had pairings given for each date.

To use the macro include it in your program like usual (e.g., `%include 'TCLINK_v3.sas`). You must have subscriptions to the TAQ product and the CRSP product on WRDS, and the code must be run on the WRDS Cloud Server.
